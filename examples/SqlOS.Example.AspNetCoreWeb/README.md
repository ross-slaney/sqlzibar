# ASP.NET Core web client

This Razor Pages application is the shortest end-to-end .NET login example in the repository. It uses ASP.NET Core's built-in OpenID Connect authentication middleware against SqlOS's OpenID Provider mode—there is no JavaScript auth SDK and no custom callback controller.

The sample proves the complete lifecycle:

- OIDC discovery from `/.well-known/openid-configuration`;
- redirect to the SqlOS hosted AuthPage;
- authorization code flow with PKCE, protected correlation state, and a nonce;
- code exchange on the server with ID token signature and nonce validation;
- identity claims from the ID token, supplemented by the SqlOS UserInfo endpoint;
- an encrypted, HTTP-only ASP.NET Core session cookie;
- authenticated API calls with the issued access token;
- refresh-token rotation before an access token expires;
- refresh-token and session revocation during sign-out.

## Run it

Prerequisites:

- .NET 9 SDK;
- Docker Desktop or another Docker-compatible runtime;
- free local ports `5080`, `5090`, `18890`, and `18891` (plus `1435` when you opt into SQL Server).

From the repository root, start the Todo AppHost:

```bash
dotnet run --project examples/SqlOS.Todo.AppHost/SqlOS.Todo.AppHost.csproj
```

The AppHost starts PostgreSQL (or SQL Server), the Todo API/SqlOS host, and this Razor Pages client. Wait for its resources to become healthy, then open `http://localhost:5090` and select **Sign in with SqlOS**.

The terminal also prints an authenticated Aspire dashboard link. Its configured listener is `https://localhost:18890`; use the printed URL because it can include a local dashboard token.

On the hosted page, create a password user and organization or sign in with a user already stored in the persistent sample database. After the callback, the page shows:

- the current user, organization, client, and token expiry;
- the exact JSON returned by authenticated `GET /api/me`;
- a sign-out action that revokes the SqlOS refresh token and session before clearing the local cookie.

## What talks to what

```mermaid

    participant Browser
    participant Web as ASP.NET Core :5090
    participant SqlOS as Todo API + SqlOS :5080
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    Browser->>Web: GET /?handler=Login
    Web->>SqlOS: GET /sqlos/auth/.well-known/openid-configuration
    Web-->>Browser: Challenge + correlation cookie + nonce + PKCE
    Browser->>SqlOS: GET /sqlos/auth/authorize
    SqlOS->>DB: Authenticate user and organization
    SqlOS-->>Browser: Redirect /signin-sqlos?code=...&state=...
    Browser->>Web: OIDC middleware callback
    Web->>SqlOS: POST /sqlos/auth/token + code verifier
    Web->>SqlOS: Validate id_token (JWKS) + GET /sqlos/auth/userinfo
    Web-->>Browser: Encrypted application cookie
```

The Todo host seeds `example-aspnet` as a first-party public PKCE client with:

| Contract | Local value |
| --- | --- |
| Authority / issuer | `http://localhost:5080/sqlos/auth` |
| Discovery document | `http://localhost:5080/sqlos/auth/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| UserInfo endpoint | `http://localhost:5080/sqlos/auth/userinfo` |
| Redirect URI | `http://localhost:5090/signin-sqlos` |
| Resource/audience | `http://localhost:5080/api/todos` |
| Allowed scopes | `openid profile email offline_access todos.read todos.write` |

The client requests `openid profile email offline_access`; SqlOS intersects that with the allowlist and grants all four. Redirect URIs are exact. `/signin-sqlos` belongs to ASP.NET Core authentication middleware; it is not a Razor Page and should not be mapped as one.

## Code tour

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [`Program.cs`](Program.cs) | Cookie and OpenID Connect handlers, discovery, PKCE, scopes, and claim mapping |
| [`Pages/Index.cshtml.cs`](Pages/Index.cshtml.cs) | Challenge, authenticated API call, token display, and revoking logout |
| [`Pages/Index.cshtml`](Pages/Index.cshtml) | Signed-out flow explanation and signed-in proof UI |
| [`wwwroot/site.css`](wwwroot/site.css) | Responsive sample presentation with no frontend build step |
| [`../SqlOS.Todo.Api/Program.cs`](../SqlOS.Todo.Api/Program.cs) | Public-client registration and protected Todo resource |
| [`../SqlOS.Todo.AppHost/Program.cs`](../SqlOS.Todo.AppHost/Program.cs) | SQL, API, and client orchestration |

The important middleware configuration is intentionally standard ASP.NET Core:

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddAuthentication(options =>
    {
        options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultChallengeScheme = "SqlOS";
    })
    .AddCookie()
    .AddOpenIdConnect("SqlOS", options =>
    {
        options.Authority = $"{sqlosOrigin}/sqlos/auth";
        options.ClientId = "example-aspnet";
        options.ResponseType = "code";
        options.UsePkce = true;
        options.CallbackPath = "/signin-sqlos";
        options.SaveTokens = true;
        options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
        options.MapInboundClaims = false; // keep raw OIDC claim names (sub, email, name, sid)
        options.TokenValidationParameters.NameClaimType = "name";
        options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false; // localhost only
    });
```

`example-aspnet` is a public PKCE client (`token_endpoint_auth_method` `none`): unlike ASP.NET Core's generic OAuth handler, the OpenID Connect handler does not demand a placeholder client secret, so none is configured. The code exchange is bound by the PKCE verifier instead.

The handler resolves every endpoint from the discovery document, validates the ID token's RS256 signature against the SqlOS JWKS and checks its nonce, then—because `GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint` is enabled—calls `/sqlos/auth/userinfo` with the new access token and merges the released claims. The application identity therefore carries `sub`, `sid`, `amr`, `org_id` (when organization-scoped), `name`, `preferred_username`, `email`, and `email_verified`, released according to the granted `openid profile email` scopes. The signed-in page separately calls the protected `/api/me` endpoint with the access token, so the trust boundary stays visible: API data comes from a bearer-authenticated resource, not browser input.

## Configuration

The client reads normal ASP.NET Core configuration:

| Key | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SqlOS:Origin` | `http://localhost:5080` | Public origin of the SqlOS/Todo host |
| `SqlOS:ClientId` | `example-aspnet` | Seeded public OAuth client |

The AppHosts inject these values as `SqlOS__Origin` and `SqlOS__ClientId`. If you change the client port, callback path, origin, or resource audience, change both the OpenID Connect options and the SqlOS client registration.

## Production decisions to make

This is executable reference code, not a complete session-management product. Before adapting it to a deployed application:

- require HTTPS, leave `RequireHttpsMetadata` at its default of `true`, and set the session, correlation, and nonce cookies to `CookieSecurePolicy.Always`;
- persist ASP.NET Core Data Protection keys in a shared durable store when more than one instance serves the app;
- keep the exact redirect URI allow-listed and keep the client public only when PKCE is required;
- decide whether application claims should be copied at login, refreshed per request, or resolved from your own profile store;
- store OAuth tokens server-side with `ITicketStore` or another session/token store when cookie size or token exposure is a concern;
- coordinate access-token refresh when several concurrent requests can renew the same rotating refresh token; the sample performs one refresh from a page request and renews its authentication ticket;
- define what happens when remote revocation is unavailable. This sample logs the failure and still clears the local application session.

`SaveTokens = true` keeps the flow easy to inspect by placing the access, refresh, and ID tokens in the encrypted authentication ticket. That is convenient locally, but it can produce a large browser cookie with several tokens and claims.

## Troubleshooting

### `invalid_redirect_uri`

Use `http://localhost:5090/signin-sqlos` exactly. The scheme, host, port, and path must match the seeded client.

### Correlation or state validation fails

Do not open a callback URL manually or reuse an old callback. Start a fresh challenge from `http://localhost:5090`. SqlOS schema version 27 widens stored OAuth state for ASP.NET Core's protected state payload; let the Todo host complete schema initialization before signing in.

### Discovery fails at startup or challenge

The handler fetches `/.well-known/openid-configuration` from `SqlOS:Origin`. Confirm the Todo host is healthy at `http://localhost:5080` and that OpenID Provider mode has not been disabled in the host's SqlOS options.

### The app returns to the page without a session

Inspect the Todo API and `aspnet-web` logs in Aspire. ID token validation, the UserInfo call, or the callback can fail individually; the middleware intentionally refuses to create an incomplete local identity, and the page shows the sign-in error banner instead.

### Old users or clients remain after restart

The Todo AppHost uses a persistent SQL container and data volume. Stopping the process does not erase identity or FGA state. Remove the disposable Todo container/volume or drop its sample database only when you intentionally want a clean start.

## Build it separately

The project's only package dependency beyond the ASP.NET Core shared framework is `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect`:

```bash
dotnet build examples/SqlOS.Example.AspNetCoreWeb/SqlOS.Example.AspNetCoreWeb.csproj
```

Running the project alone still requires the Todo host at the configured origin. For the guided version of this flow, read [Sign in an ASP.NET Core app](https://sqlos.dev/docs/quickstarts/aspnet-core-login).
