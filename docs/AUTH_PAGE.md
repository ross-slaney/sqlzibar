# SqlOS AuthPage

AuthPage is SqlOS's hosted browser UI for sign in, sign up, organization selection, and the rest of the authorization-code flow.

Start here when you want the fastest path for an owned app.

AuthPage now sits inside a larger client-onboarding story:

- **Owned apps** use seeded or manual clients and hosted or headless UI
- **Portable MCP clients** can arrive through `CIMD`
- **Compatibility clients** can arrive through optional `DCR`

The UI is still just one switch:

- **Hosted**: SqlOS renders the browser pages
- **Headless**: your app renders the pages and SqlOS still owns OAuth, PKCE, codes, and tokens

## Default endpoints

When `BasePath = "/sqlos/auth"` the library exposes:

- `GET /sqlos/auth/authorize`
- `POST /sqlos/auth/token`
- `GET /sqlos/auth/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- `GET /sqlos/auth/.well-known/jwks.json`
- `GET /sqlos/auth/login`
- `GET /sqlos/auth/signup`
- `GET /sqlos/auth/invitations/accept?token=...`
- `GET /sqlos/auth/logged-out`

When enabled, SqlOS can also expose:

- `POST /sqlos/auth/register` for dynamic client registration
- `GET /sqlos/auth/headless/*` and `POST /sqlos/auth/headless/*` for headless UI flows

Email OTP, magic links, SMS OTP, and invitations are first-class AuthPage flows. Invite acceptance fixes the email to the invited address, runs the same configured credential methods, and only consumes the invitation when the final session or authorization redirect is issued. Magic-link completion uses a passive GET confirmation page followed by POST token consumption so mailbox scanners cannot sign users in by fetching the link. SMS OTP uses Twilio Verify and remains disabled until configured; see [Magic Link](MAGIC_LINK.md) and [SMS OTP](SMS_OTP.md).

## Fastest hosted setup

Use one SqlOS registration. Include auth and FGA on the same `DbContext`. Map routes after `Build()`.

```csharp
builder.AddSqlOS<AppDbContext>(options =>
{
    options.AuthServer.PublicOrigin = "https://app.example.com";
    options.AuthServer.Issuer = "https://app.example.com/sqlos/auth";
    options.AuthServer.SeedAuthPage(page =>
    {
        page.PageTitle = "Sign in";
        page.PageSubtitle = "Use the hosted SqlOS auth page for your owned web app.";
    });
    options.AuthServer.SeedOwnedWebApp(
        "web",
        "Main Web App",
        "https://app.example.com/auth/callback");
});

var app = builder.Build();
```

That gives you the simplest path:

1. Seed or create a client.
2. Send the browser to `/sqlos/auth/authorize` with PKCE.
3. Let SqlOS render the hosted pages.
4. Exchange the code at `/sqlos/auth/token`.

## Hosted vs headless

`/sqlos/auth/authorize` follows one rule:

- `BuildUiUrl` exists: your app renders the auth UI
- `BuildUiUrl` does not exist: SqlOS renders AuthPage

For invitation links, the same rule applies:

- hosted deployments render `/sqlos/auth/invitations/accept?token=...`
- headless deployments can resolve the token with `POST /sqlos/auth/headless/invitations/resolve`, then pass `invitationToken` through the normal headless start/login/signup/OTP/provider requests
- after a headless authorization request exists, view changes should preserve that request id; invite login/signup tabs should not restart as standalone links

## Clients and AuthPage

AuthPage is not limited to one client-registration mode.

You can use it with:

- seeded or dashboard-created owned clients
- discovered `CIMD` clients
- registered `DCR` clients

For most teams, the best order is:

1. start with a hosted first-party client
2. switch to headless only when you want custom UI
3. add `CIMD` or `DCR` only when you need portable or compatibility clients

## Dashboard

The auth dashboard now keeps client onboarding in one place:

- **Clients** — owned, discovered, and registered clients with filters, inspect views, and lifecycle actions
- **Auth Page** — title, colors, layout, signup toggle, logo
- **Organization Invitations** — create, resend, revoke, copy links, and inspect delivery state
- **Security** — session and refresh settings
- **Providers** — OIDC and SAML

## Notes

- Password, hosted, and headless signup validate the client, redirect, resource, invitation, and organization join policy before writing durable state. The account, membership, session or authorization code, and audits commit together; a failed validation, duplicate identity race, or later callback leaves no partial user.
- SqlOS still keeps consent simple by default.
- Password is still the default local credential path.
- `CIMD`, `DCR`, and resource indicators are now supported. Use them when you need portable or compatibility clients, not for the very first hosted setup.
- AuthPage cookies are stateful sessions. Reuse requires an active user and, when organization-scoped, an active organization and membership. Logout-all, password reset, organization deactivation, and matching SSO organization-session revocation invalidate those cookies server-side.
